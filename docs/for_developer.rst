For Developers
===============

.. note::
    
        This section is intended for developers who want to extend the functionality of the `modelforge` package
        or who want to develop their own machine learned potentials. This section explains design decicions 
        and the structure of neural network potentials.



How to deal with units
---------------------------------

All public APIs require explicit units for values that are not dimensionless.
The units are specified using the `openff.units` package, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python
    
        from openff.units import unit
    
        # A length of 1.0 angstrom
        length = 1.0 * unit.angstrom
    


Internally, when units are removed, we use the openmm units system 
`here <http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/theory/01_introduction.html#units/>`_.

To demonstrate this we can look at the `CosineCutoff` class, 
which is used to add a smooth cutoff to a distance tensor. 
The cutoff is specified in units of the length tensor, e.g.:
`unit.nanometer`. The `d_ij` tensor is passed in nanometer (but without 
explicit attached units)..

Base structure of machine learned potentials
-------------------------------------------------

The base structure of machine learned potentials is as shown in the figure below.


The :py:class:`modelforge.potential.models.BaseNetwork` class is the main class that is used to store the potential.
The :py:class:`modelforge.potential.models.CoreNetwork` class is used to store the neural network that is used to predict the potential.

The input of every neural network is the :py:class:`modelforge.dataset.dataset.NNPInput` dataclass as shown below.
Note that, for certain applications, it is useful to convert the dataclass to a `NamedTuple`, 
which can be done using the :py:meth:`modelforge.dataset.dataset.NNPInput.as_namedtuple` function.
