Training
========

Introduction
------------------------------------------

During training the parameters of a model are fitted to reproduce the target properties provided by a dataset. These are typically energies and forces, but can also be other properties provided by a dataset (e.g., dipole moments).

The properties a given model can be trained on are deterimend by the model itself and by the loss function used to train the model. Each of the models implemented in modelforge have flexible numbers of output heads, each of which can be fitted against a different property. The loss function is responsible for comparing the model's predictions to the target properties and providing a scalar value that the optimizer can use to update the model's parameters.

The training process is controlled by a configuration file, `training.toml`, which specifies the number of epochs, the learning rate, the loss function, and the splitting strategy for the dataset.

Splitting Strategies
------------------------------------------

The default splitting strategy for datasets in `modelforge` is to randomly split the dataset into 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% test sets based on records. 
This approach ensures that different conformations of a molecule are always part of the same split, thereby avoiding data leakage. 

`modelforge` also provides other splitting strategies, including:

- :class:`modelforge.dataset.utils.FirstComeFirstServeStrategy`: Splits the dataset based on the order of records.
- :class:`modelforge.dataset.utils.RandomSplittingStrategy`: Splits the dataset randomly based on conformations.

To use a different data split ratio, you can specify a custom split list in the splitting strategy. 
The most effective way to pass this information to the training process is by defining the appropriate fields in the `dataset.toml` file, as shown in :ref:`dataset-configuration`.
